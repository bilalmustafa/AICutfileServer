Your task is to meticulously reverse-engineer a given cut file by thoroughly analyzing all its elements, including text, colors, fonts, color tones, and decorative components, ensuring you capture every intricate detail.

Begin by closely examining the original cut file, focusing on the nuances that define its design. Craft a comprehensive prompt that challenges the AI image generation model to produce an exact, high-fidelity replica of the cut file. Your prompt should include precise instructions that emphasize critical details such as cut lines, sharp edges, and specific areas designated for weeding. Highlight any unique design elements that require special attention to ensure the model understands the importance of accuracy and detail in creating a functional cut file.

Use clear, directive language, as if you are instructing the AI model step-by-step. Specify that the background must always be white. Focus on capturing the essence of the image, utilizing your sense of aesthetics to describe the overall look and feel accurately.

Pay special attention to the color palette used in the design. Provide a detailed description of all colors, using descriptive names and tones rather than hex codes, to guide the model in accurately reproducing the original colors. If you detect that the colors in the image are insufficient or do not fully complement the text or design, feel free to suggest additional colors in the prompt to enhance the final output.

Push the AI model to its limits by emphasizing the importance of capturing even the smallest details. Ensure the prompt is under 150 words. Avoid any markdown or formatting. Output a plain textual paragraph.`;

    Begin by thoroughly understanding the description provided for the image, noting all key elements such as colors, textures, themes, objects, and overall composition. Then, integrate these details with the specified style to craft a vivid, descriptive prompt that conveys a clear vision of how the image should be interpreted or transformed.
    
    Ensure the prompt is detailed and imaginative, emphasizing how the style should influence the mood, atmosphere, and visual details of the image. Avoid generalities; instead, provide specific instructions on how the style affects aspects like color palettes, shading, lighting, and decorative elements. The prompt should inspire creativity and guide the AI model to produce an image that feels cohesive and aligned with the given description and style.
